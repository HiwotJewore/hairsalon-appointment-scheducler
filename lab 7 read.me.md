# Lab 7 â€“ Kubernetes on AWS

## Overview
In this lab, we containerized the Appointment Scheduler app and deployed it to a **Kubernetes cluster** on AWS (EKS or Minikube).  
This lab introduces container orchestration concepts, scaling, and service discovery.

---

## Objectives
- Package the application into a **Docker container**.
- Create Kubernetes **manifests** (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap).
- Deploy the app to a Kubernetes cluster.
- Expose the app externally using a **LoadBalancer Service**.
- Verify scaling and rolling updates.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed and running  
- kubectl CLI installed  
- AWS CLI configured
