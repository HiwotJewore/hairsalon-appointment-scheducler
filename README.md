# Hair Salon Appointment Scheduler

This project is a web application for scheduling hair salon appointments. It helps salon staff manage bookings efficiently and ensures clients’ appointments are tracked reliably.  

## Key Features

- Schedule, view, and manage appointments  
- Simple and clean user interface  
- Email reminders for upcoming appointments  

## What We Did in Lab 5

1. **Database Upgrade** – Switched from SQLite to **Amazon RDS** for a scalable, cloud-based database.  
2. **Data Verification** – Verified that appointments are correctly written to the database.  
3. **Docker & CI/CD** – Added a `Dockerfile` for containerization and `buildspecs` for automated testing.  
4. **Professional README** – Documented the project so it’s easy for anyone to understand and use.  

## How It Works

1. Users add an appointment through the app.  
2. The app writes the appointment to **RDS**.  
3. Staff can view upcoming appointments and manage them efficiently.
